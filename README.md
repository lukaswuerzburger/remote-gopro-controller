# remote-gopro-controller

This is a project to build a software that triggers GoPro features from another machine using a Raspberry Pi as the controller in the middle. Since the GoPro API is only available via Wifi the Raspberry Pi needs to handle Ethernet and Wifi at the same time.

### First Goal

The first goal is to take photos from the GoPro triggered by a computer in the same network. 

### Second Goal

Second goal would be to open up ports to make it accessible from the internet, so that you can use your phone or another computer that aren't in the same network.
